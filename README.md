This is a project for my New Media Interactive Development capstone class. It is a Simon says game powered by AI. The project involves a physical interface made with Arduino, a Node.js server and a connection to the Open AI API. 

Running the project requires an Open AI API key.

The game logic and API functions are in the Utils folder.
